A look in to the relationships of a country's emissions per capita and life expectancy.
 
**Objective**

To look at relationships between emissions and life expectancy. I was interested to see if there is a correlation between the two. Increased emissions over the years can suggest a country is developing and therefore such things as education and medical care would likely improve.


**Data**

* Emissions
* Global life expectancies
* UK life expectancies

**Folders**

* Project brief, data sourcing and profile
* Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. 
* Sripts: Contains the Python coding involved for the analysis.
* Visualisation: Contains visualisations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report.
